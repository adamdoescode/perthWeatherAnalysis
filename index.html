                    <h1>⛈ Perth and surrounds rainfall and temperature analysis ☀</h1>
                    <p>
                        Having recently moved to Perth from Newcastle I am intrigued by the different weather patterns
                        here in Perth.
                        The most striking feature is that rainfall in Perth is *seasonal* while in Newcastle it is
                        mostly constant year round.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So I wanted to explore the nature of rainfall in Perth. Fortunately, it is easy to get data for
                        any Australian weather
                        site from the <a href="http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/data/?ref=ftr">Bureau of Meterology
                            website</a>. Unfortunately, this no longer
                        works for some reason (the element you click to download data still has a download tag, but
                        instead of data, it returns
                        a zipped 403 page). Instead, I have used the NOAA hosted GHCN data for Perth Airport (which
                        comes from the BOM anyway) which you can
                        access <a
                            href="https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/datasets/GHCND/stations/GHCND:ASN00009021/detail">here</a>.

                        Documentation for the column names can be found
                        [here](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/pub/data/cdo/documentation/GHCND_documentation.pdf). In brief
                        they are:

                        The data I am using in this notebook is the daily rainfall totals and temperature for Perth
                        Airport weather station.
                        It has been continuously monitoring rainfall since May 1944! This allows us to get a good grasp
                        on the seasonal rainfall
                        patterns in Perth and also what the year to year trend looks like.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Showcase graphs and summary</h2>
                    <p>Probably the most striking feature of rain in Perth is just how seasonal it is. Looking at our
                        first graph below we can see
                        any given day in January has less than 10% chance of any rain while a given day in July has over
                        50% chance of any rain!
                        The month to month change is dramatic, with the change in rainfall chance shifting rapidly in
                        autumn and spring.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        While summers are incredibly hot, and the UV index is dangerous, summer is a great time to plan
                        outdoor activities that
                        would be otherwise ruined by rain. In contrast, expect the opposite in winter.

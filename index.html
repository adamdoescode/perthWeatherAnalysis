            <p>
                Having recently moved to Perth from Newcastle I am intrigued by the different weather patterns here in Perth. 
                The most striking feature is that rainfall in Perth is *seasonal* while in Newcastle it is mostly constant year round.
            </p>
            <p>
                So I wanted to explore the nature of rainfall in Perth. Fortunately, it is easy to get data for any Australian weather 
                site from the [Bureau of Meterology website](http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/data/?ref=ftr). Unfortunately, this no longer 
                works for some reason (the element you click to download data still has a download tag, but instead of data, it returns 
                a zipped 403 page). Instead, I have used the GHCN data for Perth Airport (which comes from the BOM anyway) which you can 
                access [here](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/datasets/GHCND/stations/GHCND:ASN00009021/detail).
            </p>
            <p>
                Documentation for the column names can be found [here](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/pub/data/cdo/documentation/GHCND_documentation.pdf). In brief they are:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>STATION (17 characters) is the station identification code.</li>
                <li>STATION_NAME (max 50 characters) is the name of the station.</li>
                <li>GEOGRAPHIC_LOCATION (31 characters) is the latitude, longitude, and elevation above mean sea level.</li>
                <li>DATE is the year of the record (4 digits) followed by month (2 digits) and day (2 digits).</li>
                <li>PRCP = Precipitation (mm).</li>
                <li>SNOW = Snowfall (mm).</li>
                <li>SNWD = Snow depth (mm).</li>
                <li>TMAX = Maximum temperature (Celsius).</li>
                <li>TMIN = Minimum temperature (Celsius).</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                The data I am using in this notebook is the daily rainfall totals and temperature for Perth Airport weather station. 
                It has been continuously monitoring rainfall since May 1944! This allows us to get a good grasp on the seasonal rainfall 
                patterns in Perth and also what the year to year trend looks like.
